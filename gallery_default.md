Default gallery 
===

To have your own gallery and content here, do the following:

* create a folder called ```contrib```
* create a file called ```gallery.md```
* inside the ```contrib``` folder, create a folder called ```img``` - this is where you can place images to be served 

The reload button will call a script called ```reload.sh``` in the contrib folder - useful for pulling content from a version management system (e.g. Github)
